================

Enables greater flexibility in creating journeys through the website

### Getting started

* Run `make debug`

### Dependencies

* Mongo db (can use [dp-compose](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-compose) to stand up an instance in docker container, this requires docker)
* Once you have a working mongo db instance, you will want to populate your database with topics; **TODO** further instructions/scripts needed
* No further dependencies other than those defined in `go.mod`
